# Example of how to import Matter and Poly-Decomp Libraries with Parcel

This project demonstrates how to successfully import the `matter` and `poly-decomp` libraries into a web app built with `parcel`.

To run it:
1. Clone the library locally `git clone ...`
2. Install dependencies by running `yarn`
3. Build the project with `yarn start`

You should see the matter-js and poly-decomp exports logged to the console.
